                    Ask Ben Solo: A fan project in transmedia storytelling
                </h4>

                <div class="projectimage">

                <p><em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em> came out in 2015, revealing that Princess Leia and Han Solo had
                    a son named Ben who turned to the Dark Side of the Force. At the time, I was 16 years old and
                    struggling with loneliness, anxiety about growing up, and a general lack of confidence in my life’s
                    purpose. Surely even a Dark Side villain with famous parents must have experienced that too?</p>

                <p>Ask Ben Solo is a Tumblr blog that explores that very concept with a balance of sincerity and humor.
                    During three of my own teenage years, I chronicled Ben’s life from ages 15 to 18, answering
                    questions submitted by the blog’s fans with drawings, comics, journal entries, poetry, animations,
                    and soundclips. I fleshed out his relationships with his parents, his fears and anxieties, and his
                    coming of age journey, reaching a wide audience of fellow teenagers and people who remembered what
                    it was like to grow up. Though I never officially ended the blog (I like to make it seem like Ben is
                    still out there, somewhere, being an adult), I consider it a finished project, and think fondly on
                    the fun I had while running it.</p>

                    “Wonderful”: A short film about loving my body

                <p><em>“Yeah, I can’t be a Rockette<br>
                        Or model for Victoria’s Secret<br>
                        But let me tell you a secret—<br>
                        Victoria can keep it!<br>
                        I’m only five feet tall<br>
                        And my waist isn’t that small<br>
                        But I like the way I was designed, that’s all!”
                    </em></p>

                <p>As an artist, I seek to question the aesthetic ideals that society and culture have placed on our
                    bodies. Produced in my junior year at UC Davis for an Animation class, “Wonderful” is a short film
                    that combines hand-drawn rotoscope animation, live-action footage, and spoken-word narration to tell
                    a love story between me and my body. I wrote and performed the narration, shot the footage, animated
                    the rotoscope sequences, and edited the film myself, with music licensed under Creative Commons.</p>

                    Maya walk cycle: A walk cycle animated in Maya
                </h4>

                </div>

                <p>This walk cycle is my first experimentation with a character rig in Maya (the Andy rig, a free rig
                    made by the Savannah College of Art and Design). It was an assignment for my Character Animation
                    class in junior year.</p>

                <p>I wanted to create a walk cycle that demonstrates a strong sense of personality in only a small
                    number of repeating frames. I animated the character with a quick, sassy, bold strut. For my first
                    full-body animation, I’m pleased with the results.</p>

                    “The Ones Who Reap” Trailer: A trailer for a horror short film

                </h4>

                <div class="videoWrapper">
                    <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/420971327" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"
                        allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>

                <p>My freshman year at UC Davis, I was involved with the Davis Filmmaking Society and edited a horror
                    short called “The Ones Who Reap.” Since “The Ones Who Reap” wasn’t my own project, editing this film
                    taught me how to collaborate with the director, screenwriter, and composer to achieve one artistic
                    vision.</p>

                <p>While on the project, I created this promotional trailer for the film’s premiere using available
                    footage, music composed for the film, and royalty-free sound effects to build a horror soundscape.
                    As I worked, I realized that editing a trailer is different than editing a film (in fact, most major
                    studios outsource their trailers to other companies that specialize in film promotion). The goal of
                    a trailer isn’t just to communicate the story of the film, but more importantly, to communicate why
                    an audience should see it. For this trailer, I focused on building a growing sense of dread,
                    apprehension, and intrigue.</p>

                    Western Plains: An original MIDI composition
                </h4>

                <div class="projectimage"><img src="images/screen.png"></div>

                        shakespeareansushi</a></iframe>

                <p>This project was an assignment for a video games course called 20 Years of RPG Maker 2000. I used a
                    program called Aria Maestosa to compose a looping MIDI soundtrack, then imported it into an “ambient
                    game” I made in RPG Maker 2000. The game is not meant to be played, but provides visuals to go along
                    with the musical composition.</p>

                <p>I was inspired by music from spaghetti westerns, and various other video game scores that seek to
                    recreate that style. The final composition is both an homage to and a loving parody of Wild
                    West-themed music.</p>
